'''
In this chatbot, the responses are based on common questions related to data science, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. The regular expressions used to match the user's input to the appropriate response are simple and can be improved to handle more complex questions. The chatbot can be extended by adding more responses to cover other topics in data science.
