    if "difference" in question.lower() and ("online" in question.lower() or "offline" in question.lower()):
        return "Online learning is a type of machine learning that happens in real-time as new data comes in, while offline or batch learning occurs when a model is trained on a fixed dataset. Online learning is useful for scenarios where the data is constantly changing or where computational resources are limited, while offline learning is more suited for scenarios where the data is relatively stable and resources are more abundant."
    elif "difference" in question.lower() and ("stochastic" in question.lower() or "gradient descent" in question.lower()):
        return "The main difference between stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and standard gradient descent (GD) is that SGD updates the parameters (weights) of the model after each training example, while GD updates the parameters after all training examples have been processed. This makes SGD faster and more efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces."
    elif "backpropagation" in question.lower() and "hidden layers" in question.lower():
        return "Backpropagation can work well with multiple hidden layers, but the training process may be slower and more difficult to optimize. This is because the gradients can become diluted or vanish as they propagate through the layers, making it harder for the lower layers to learn meaningful representations. Techniques such as weight initialization, activation functions, and batch normalization can help mitigate these issues."
    elif "rectified linear units" in question.lower():
        return "Rectified linear units (ReLU) is an activation function commonly used in deep learning. It returns 0 for negative inputs and the input value for non-negative inputs, making it computationally efficient and easy to optimize. ReLU has been shown to be effective in a wide range of deep learning applications."
    elif "softmax function" in question.lower():
        return "Softmax function is used for the output layer of artificial neural networks to ensure that the sum of the output components is equal to 1 and to obtain a probability distribution over the possible classes. This is useful for classification tasks where the model needs to assign a probability to each possible class."
    elif "regularization methods" in question.lower():
        return "Some common regularization methods for artificial neural networks include L1/L2 regularization, weight decay, dropout, batch normalization, data augmentation, and early stopping. These methods are used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance."
