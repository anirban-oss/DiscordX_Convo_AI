'''

This code reads in a text file named input.txt, and writes the modified text to a new file named output.txt. The code uses the re module to define a regex pattern that matches names (i.e., one or more capitalized words separated by spaces). It then iterates over the lines in the input file, applies the regex pattern to each line using the sub() method to replace any matches with an empty string, and writes the modified line to the output file. This effectively removes all instances of names from the text.
