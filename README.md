# DiscordX_Convo_AI     
NLP project for KaggleX Mentorship programme.     
    
We use Discord bot to talk about Machine learning as a subject and context specific help by learning what is being discussed in channels in the server.   
We hope to be able to cite how the bot learned about the information and also show the original text using regex.
